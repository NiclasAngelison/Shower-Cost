# By Niclas Angelison

- [ ] Project overview


# With an ongoing energy crisis and high heating costs throughout Europe, I thought I would find out how much a shower costs. So my project is to show how long do you shower and how much does it cost? With an ESP32 board, two Dallas DS18B20 temerature senors and a FLow sensor YF-B10 i manage to setup Blynk cloud and the data i presented in the Blynk App. The projekt toke about one week to total to finish.
